Today I bought a cool domain: [netw0rk.io](https://netw0rk.io).
I will migrate all my services to this domain. I will also start to advertise some of the services I already run for some time like my Tor relay.

All this is part of the transformation from "software programing" to "cyber security" and "distributed networking". Don't get me wrong, I will not get rid of
my sBani nickname, but maybe I will use an other one in the future too. I'm not sure about it yet.
