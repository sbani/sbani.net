When I met my girlfriend five years ago, she told me about her plans to travel the world. The last years,
we travelled as much as we can and I found out that that this, beside her and hacking & programming, is what I really love.
Well, time flies and we all know that if you really want something you will have to do it - and if you are lucky enough
to live in a part of the world where money is present.

**To cut a long story short, we are will start to travel the world in March 2018 for around one year.**

During that time, I will try to work on **Bug Bounties** and do a little bit of Software Development.
So if you need a security audit, drop me an email.

Stay safe!
