## About me
My name is Sufijen Bani and I'm born in 1988. Growing up in Munich was great and I still enjoy the city-life here. But I also love to travel, meet new people, cultures and I'm not rooted in Germany. My ten month round the world trip was the biggest adventure in my life, yet.

Programming, especially for the web, is my passion and my job. I code in PHP, Go, Javascript (NodeJS) and a little Python. For the moment PHP and Go are my daily business.

Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking are topics I love since the very beginning. My skills are solid and proofed and I make use of them every day.

## What I've Worked With
I've worked with with the following tools for some time during my job or in my spare time. Always serious enough to be comfortable to use or not to use them in prod. Please do not consider the list as complete.

 - PHP: Symphony, Kohana, Zend, Silex, Behat, ...
 - Go: Echo, BoltDB, Dep, ...
 - Databases: MYSQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis, Elastic Search, ...
 - DevOps: Docker, Rancher, Ansible, Mailgun, Nginx, Caddy, ...
 - NodeJS: KoaJS, Express, ...
 - Projectmanagement: Jira, Confluence, Git, Bitbucket, Github, ClubHouse, Gitlab, ...
 - Other: TravisCI, Wercker, Unit Testing, ...

## Contributions & Projects
The list of contributions and my own projects is getting bigger and bigger because I love open source and working in distributed teams.
Take a look at most of them on [@Github](https://github.com/sbani)

Although I'm not active at the moment, I'm one of the founder and programmer of [Serlo](https://serlo.org), a non-profit organization and website where students and everybody else can find help for Math, Biology, etc ... FOR FREE!
