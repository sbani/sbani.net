## About me
My name is Sufijen Bani and I'm born in 1988. Growing up in Munich was great and I still enjoy the city-life here. But I also love to travel, meet new people, cultures and I'm not rooted in Germany.

Programming, especially for the web, is my passion and my job. I code in PHP, Javascript (NodeJS) and a little Go and Python. For the moment PHP is my daily business.

## What I've worked with
The tools in the list above are tools I've worked with for some time during my jobs and in my spare time. But just things where I know what I'm doing.
 - PHP, Symphony, Kohana, Zend
 - MYSQL/MariaDB
 - Bootstrap, jQuery
 - KoaJS/Express
 - Jira, Confluence, Git, Bitbucket, Github, Codio
 - OroCRM, Bolt, Hexo.io
 - Divshot, TravisCI, Wercker, Ansible, New Relic

## Contributions/Projects
The list of smaller contributions is getting bigger and bigger because I love open source and hope to make the world a better place.
See most of them [@Github](https://github.com/sbani)

Although I'm not active at the moment, I'm one of the founder and programmer of [Serlo](https://serlo.org), a non-profit organization/website where children find exercises and help for school. FOR FREE!
