## About me
My name is Sufijen Bani and I'm born in 1988. Growing up in Munich was great and I still enjoy the city-life here. But I also love to travel, meet new people, cultures and I'm not rooted in Germany.

Programming, especially for the web, is my passion and my job. I code in PHP, Go, Javascript (NodeJS) and a little Python. For the moment PHP and Go are my daily business.

Ethical Hacking and the whole IT-Security are topics I love from the beginning. My skills are solid and I wish it will be part of my future job description.

## What I've Worked With
The tools in the following list are tools I've worked with for some time during my jobs and in my spare time. But just things where I know what I'm doing.
 - PHP: Symphony, Kohana, Zend, Silex, Behat, ...
 - Go: Echo, BoltDB, Dep, ...
 - Databases: MYSQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis, ...
 - DevOps: Docker, Rancher, Ansible, Mailgun, Nginx, ...

## Contributions & Projects
The list of contributions and my own projects is getting bigger and bigger because I love open source and working in distributed teams.

Although I'm not active at the moment, I'm one of the founder and programmer of [Serlo](https://serlo.org), a non-profit organization and website where students and everybody else can find exercises. FOR FREE!
