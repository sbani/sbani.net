Reading the very funny and good written article about "[How to complain about Go](https://medium.com/@divan/how-to-complain-about-go-349013e06d24#.29luhvrlr)" from [Ivan Danyliuk](https://divan.github.io/), I thought about how a PHP Developer can complain about Go.

## ...PHP
Coming from PHP your main argument for not using Go is that Go is way too complicated for you. Using a typed language is a mess, because how the hell should you know what type you want 3 methods further. As a programmer you have to feel the same way the user inputs data: He just thinks about his current step.
Another argument is that you probably want to read code like you read a book in the real world: From top to bottom. Thinking about channels and goroutines is crazy, because in books you do not want to jump back too!
And last but not least you avoid Go because of the Garbage Collector topic: Why is a community even talking about GC?
